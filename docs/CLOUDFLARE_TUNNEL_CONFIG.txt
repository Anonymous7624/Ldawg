CLOUDFLARE TUNNEL CONFIGURATION
===============================

The upload server runs on port 8082 and needs its own tunnel hostname.

REQUIRED TUNNEL CONFIGURATION:
------------------------------

Add to your cloudflared config.yml (typically at ~/.cloudflared/config.yml):

ingress:
  - hostname: ws.ldawg7624.com
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - hostname: upload.ldawg7624.com
    service: http://localhost:8082
  - service: http_status:404

EXPLANATION:
- ws.ldawg7624.com -> port 8080 (WebSocket + tank game server)
- upload.ldawg7624.com -> port 8082 (HTTP upload service)

After updating the config, restart cloudflared:
  sudo systemctl restart cloudflared

Or if running manually:
  cloudflared tunnel run

VERIFY:
After cloudflared restarts, test:
  curl -i https://upload.ldawg7624.com/
Should return: {"service":"Kennedy Chat Upload Service","status":"ok","port":8082}
